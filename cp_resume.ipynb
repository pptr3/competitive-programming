    "There is a certain code pattern for all the algorithms of backtracking. For example, one can find one template in our Explore card of Recursion II.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skeleton of the algorithm is a loop that iterates through each cell in the grid. For each cell, we invoke the backtracking function (i.e. backtrack()) to check if we would obtain a solution, starting from this very cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the backtracking function backtrack(row, col, suffix), as a DFS algorithm, it is often implemented as a recursive function. The function can be broke down into the following four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1). At the beginning, first we check if we reach the bottom case of the recursion, where the word to be matched is empty, i.e. we have already found the match for each prefix of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2). We then check if the current state is invalid, either the position of the cell is out of the boundary of the board or the letter in the current cell does not match with the first letter of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3). If the current step is valid, we then start the exploration of backtracking with the strategy of DFS. First, we mark the current cell as visited, e.g. any non-alphabetic letter will do. Then we iterate through the four possible directions, namely up, right, down and left. The order of the directions can be altered, to one's preference.\n",

For any kind of tree traversal, we always have the easiest of solutions which is based on recursion. Next, we have a custom stack based iterative version of the same solution. Finally, we want a tree traversal that doesn't use any kind of additional space at all. There is a well known tree traversal out there that doesn't use any additional space at all. It's known as `Morris Traversal`. Our solution is based off of the same ideology, but Morris Traversal is not a pre-requisite here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what's difference between the nodes processing of this approach and basic recursion, let's look at a sample tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"11.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "With recursion, we only re-wire the connections for the \"current node\" once we are already done processing the left and the right subtrees `completely`. Let's see what that looks like in a figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"12.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the `postponing` of rewiring of connections on the current node until the left subtree is done, is basically what recursion is. Recursion is all about postponing decisions until something else is completed. In order for us to be able to postpone stuff, we need to use the stack. However, in our current approach we want to get rid of the stack altogether. So, we will have to come up with a `greedy` way that will be costlier in terms of time, but will be space efficient in achieving the same results.\n",
    "\n",
    "`For a current node, we will check if it has a left child or not. If it does, we will find the last node in the rightmost branch of the subtree rooted at this left child. Once we find this \"rightmost\" node, we will hook it up with the right child of the current node.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this idea on our current sample tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"13.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This might not make a lot of sense just yet. But, bear with me and read on. Let's see what connections we need to establish or shuffle once we find that \"rightmost node\". We are highlighting \"rightmost\" here because technically, even without knowing this approach, the node `2`3 would have made much more sense here, right? Instead, we are doing some vodoo with the node `6`. God knows why!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"14.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous paragraph, this figure would make much more sense if we had just found out the node `23`, and set its right child to `1` instead of doing all this with `6`. Why did we do that you might ask? Well, it's an optimization of sorts. To find the actual \"rightmost\" node of subtree, we might have to potentially traverse most of that subtree. Like in our example. To actually get to the node `23`, we would have had to traverse all of the nodes: `2, 6, 44, 23`. Instead, we simply stop at the node `6`. We'll see why that also achieves our final purpose. For now, let's move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing the following operation for every node, we are simply try ing to move stuff to the right hand side one step at a time. The reason we used the node `6` in the above example and not `23` is the very reason we called this approach somewhat greedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing of the node `2` is simple since it doesn't have a left child at all. So we have nothing to do here. Let's come over to the node `6` since this is where things get interesting and start to make sense. We'll again use the same logic as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "`For a current node, we will check if it has a left child or not. If it does, we will find the last node in the rightmost branch of the subtree rooted at this left child. Once we find this \"rightmost\" node, we will hook it up with the right child of the current node.`\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can clearly see from the previous figures, the rightmost node here would be `23`. So, let's look at the tree after we are done rewiring the connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"15.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this looks just like the tree after the recursion would have completed on the left subtree and we rewired the connections, right? Exactly!. The reason we stopped at the `first rightmost node with no right child` was because we would eventually end up `rightyfying` all the subtrees through that connection. Even though before we didn't hook up the node `23`, we were able to do it when we arrived at the node `6` here.\n",

    "\n",
    "This problem is yet another problem concerning the traversal of 2D grid, e.g. Robot room cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "`As similar to the traversal problems in a tree structure, there are generally two approaches in terms of solution: DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search).`\n",
    "\n",
    "One can apply either of the above strategies to traverse the 2D grid, while taking some specific actions to resolve the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a traversal strategy (DFS or BFS), there could be a thousand implementations for a thousand people, if we indulge ourselves to exaggerate a bit. However, there are some common neat techniques that we could apply along with both of the strategies, in order to obtain a more optimized solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach 1: DFS**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "`The goal of this problem is to mark those captured cells.`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are asked to summarize the algorithm in one sentence, it would be that we enumerate all those candidate cells (i.e. the ones filled with `O`), and check one by one if they are captured or not, i.e. we start with a candidate cell (`O`), and then apply either DFS or BFS strategy to explore its surrounding cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with the DFS algorithm, which usually results in a more concise code than the BFS algorithm. The algorithm consists of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1). We select all the cells that are located on the borders of the board.\n",
    "- Step 2). Start from each of the above selected cell, we then perform the DFS traversal.\n",
    "     - If a cell on the border happens to be `O`, then we know that this cell is alive, together with the other `O` cells that are connected to this border cell, based on the description of the problem. Two cells are connected, if there exists a path consisting of only `O` letter that bridges between the two cells.\n",
    "     - Based on the above conclusion, the goal of our DFS traversal would be to *mark* out all those `connected` `O` cells that is originated from the border, with any distinguished letter such as `E`.\n",
    "- Step 3). Once we iterate through all border cells, we would then obtain three types of cells:\n",
    "    - The one with the `X` letter: the cell that we could consider as the wall.\n",
    "    - The one with the `O` letter: the cells that are spared in our DFS traversal, i.e. these cells has no connection to the border, therefore they are captured. We then should replace these cell with `X` letter.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We demonstrate how the DFS works with an example in the following animation (where the white cells that we are marking with a light blue are the cells with `O`).\n",
